When a Spell/Trap Card, or monster effect, is activated, while you control a "Clear Wing" Synchro monster : Negate the activation. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect : You can target 1 of your banished "Clear Wing" cards; add it to your hand.
You can only use 1 "WhirlWing of the Dragon" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
